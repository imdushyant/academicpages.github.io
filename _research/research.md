#Research Interests:
- Understanding climate-vegetation interaction using ecosystem models.
- Analyzing the impact of climate change on biomes and ecosystem services.
- Application of remote sensing data and land surface models to understand eco-hydrological changes.

#A brief introduction to my current work
My interest is in understanding the climate-vegetation interactions at different spatial and temporal scales with the help of process-based ecosystem models. As a part of my research, I work with the aDGVM2, a dynamic vegetation model with a focus to understand the ecological functions and processes. To achieve these goals, I work to improve the representation of the ecological processes in the model by including new traits- trade-offs that would allow simulating the distribution of vegetation and its diversity. My current works include studying the ecosystem of tropical Asia and I use this model to simulate the distribution of vegetation patterns and investigate impacts of climate change on plant-trait diversity at the regional level.
